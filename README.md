# Slideshow for Cube Collective coding task in React

Live version: https://slideshow-musaa-cube.herokuapp.com/

### To start up locally

```jsx
npm run startLocal
```
Just a quick run-through of the application I used images from Unsplash which I selected various image sizes, the arrows on the side and the pagination at the bottom are clickable and also the slideshow autoplay and the site is responsive as well
